               :title " Introduction to Programming for Scientists. "
               :description "This course serves as an introduction to programming and computational science. Topics covered include solving problems with computers, storing and retrieving data, common algorithms, data structures, procedures, functions, object-oriented programming, and applications of programming from different domains.  3 cr, 3 lec, 1.5 lab"}
              {:code "CSCI 1060U"
               :title "Programming Workshop I"
               :description "This is a first intensive course on computer programming that covers both theory and practice. The lectures introduce modern concepts in program design and construction along with features of modern object-oriented programming languages. The laboratories provide an opportunity to apply these concepts to practical programming problems. Topics that are covered in this course include program design, problem solving strategies, program documentation, memory management and object-oriented program design. 3 cr, 3 lec, 3 lab."}
